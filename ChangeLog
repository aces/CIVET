    * Marching-cubes algorithm for extraction of white surface
    * Improved node movement in surface fit program
    * Corrected functional for Laplacian constraint in surface
      fit program (for gray surface)
    * Improved surface registration by geometric smoothing of
      the surface
    * Cleaner medial cut through the corpus callosum and better
      filling of the ventricles
    * New verify figures for Laplacian fit and surface-surface
      intersections
    * Now use smoothing from depth_potential instead of diffuse
      (no more need for BLAS and LAPACK)
