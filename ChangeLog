    * New verify figures for Laplacian fit and surface-surface
      intersections
    * Improved linear registration (based on blurred image only,
      no longer uses gradients of image, using mutual information,
      with neck-cropping, target mask on last stage)
    * Improved non-linear registration (with 2mm steps, extra sampling
      and reduced weight parameter)
    * Improved masking of white matter mask using cortical_surface
      with a new model (on which the non-linear transform is applied)
    * Masking of bright blood vessels applied to white matter mask
    * Application of population model's head mask to reduce background
      noise in image before mincbet (could do it before native N3 as well)
    * Generation of basic glim file as part of the CIVET QC
    * Now use smoothing from depth_potential instead of diffuse
      for cortical thickness and surface registration (no more need
      for BLAS and LAPACK). Note: 20mm with old code is like 30mm
      with new code.
    * Improved filling of ventricles
    * Fixed WM/GM border by not allowing CSF/BG next to WM (under
      brainstem, mostly)
    * Plug-in for ADNI population template
    * PMP option for msub (moab) instead of qsub

    * New model Cerebellum_Ventricles_SubCortical_Mask.mnc for
      masking regions
    * Marching-cubes algorithm for extraction of white surface
    * Improved node movement in surface fit program
    * Corrected functional for Laplacian constraint in surface
      fit program (for gray surface)
    * Improved surface registration by geometric smoothing of
      the surface
    * Cleaner medial cut through the corpus callosum and better
      filling of the ventricles
    * New verify figures for Laplacian fit and surface-surface
      intersections
    * Now use smoothing from depth_potential instead of diffuse
      (no more need for BLAS and LAPACK)

    * Vertex-based cortical volumes on resampled surfaces
    * AAL atlas for surface parcellation (Gaolang Gong)

2009-07-29  Claude Lepage <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
    * Initial release/creation
