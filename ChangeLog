    * allow native scans in stereotaxic space without linear transformation
    * pve with iterative correction of thresholds, masking of cerebellum
      and brainstem, sub-cortical tissue class
    * sub-cortical tissue class to VBM
    * study prefix is optional
    * preserve true native space with direction cosines and field of view
    * compute several thickess methods at once
    * increase search radius for white surface gradient correction and
      use Taubin smoothing on white surface
    * add partial volume estimates to Laplacian field for gray surface
      expansion
    * start IBIS v24 model
    * implement parallelization of subjects via mpirun
    * QC: add gradient, distortion and convergence graphs
    * average_surface_builder: allow non-linear mode, add Taubin smoothing

2014-11-03  Claude Lepage <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
    * -mpi option for filling compute nodes on HPCs

2014-09-24  Claude Lepage <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
    * Marching-cubes algorithm for white surface extraction
    * New surface models for ICBM, Colin27 and IBIS-Samir based on
      marching-cubes
    * New surface parcellations for DKT-40
    * New script for generation of average surfaces (in development)
    * GM-WM t1-gradient calibration of white surface
    * Improved CIVET QC pipeline (faster, more complete)
    * Improved surface registration parameters (hopefully better)
    * Corrections for processing at 0.5mm voxel size
    * Hi-res cortical surfaces and registration
    * ANIMAL volume segmentation added back 
    * Corrected fwhm for surface smoothing
    * Now using new N3 (1.12.0 or higher with EBTKS-1.6.4) and new pve
    * Masked hippocampus and amygdala for icbm152nl_09s and ADNIhires models

2013-02-01  Claude Lepage <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
    * New verify figures for Laplacian fit and surface-surface
      intersections
    * Improved linear registration (based on blurred image only,
      no longer uses gradients of image, using mutual information,
      with neck-cropping, target mask on last stage)
    * Improved non-linear registration (with 2mm steps, extra sampling
      and reduced weight parameter)
    * Improved masking of white matter mask using cortical_surface
      with a new model (on which the non-linear transform is applied)
    * Masking of bright blood vessels applied to white matter mask
    * Application of population model's head mask to reduce background
      noise in image before mincbet (could do it before native N3 as well)
    * Generation of basic glim file as part of the CIVET QC
    * Now use smoothing from depth_potential instead of diffuse
      for cortical thickness and surface registration (no more need
      for BLAS and LAPACK). Note: 20mm with old code is like 30mm
      with new code.
    * Improved filling of ventricles
    * Fixed WM/GM border by not allowing CSF/BG next to WM (under
      brainstem, mostly)
    * Plug-in for ADNI population template
    * PMP option for msub (moab) instead of qsub

2011-06-08  Claude Lepage <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
    * New model Cerebellum_Ventricles_SubCortical_Mask.mnc for
      masking regions
    * Marching-cubes algorithm for extraction of white surface
    * Improved node movement in surface fit program
    * Corrected functional for Laplacian constraint in surface
      fit program (for gray surface)
    * Improved surface registration by geometric smoothing of
      the surface
    * Cleaner medial cut through the corpus callosum and better
      filling of the ventricles
    * New verify figures for Laplacian fit and surface-surface
      intersections
    * Now use smoothing from depth_potential instead of diffuse
      (no more need for BLAS and LAPACK)

2010-11-04  Claude Lepage <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
    * Vertex-based cortical volumes on resampled surfaces
    * AAL atlas for surface parcellation (Gaolang Gong)

2009-07-29  Claude Lepage <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
    * Initial release/creation
