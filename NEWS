        New in Release 1.2.0
* Marching-cubes algorithm for extraction of white surface
* Improved node movement in surface fit program
* Corrected functional for Laplacian constraint in surface
  fit program (for gray surface)
* Improved surface registration by geometric smoothing of
  the surface
* Cleaner medial cut through the corpus callosum and better
  filling of the ventricles
* New verify figures for Laplacian fit and surface-surface
  intersections
* Now use smoothing from depth_potential instead of diffuse
  (no more need for BLAS and LAPACK)

NOTE: This release requires the package surface-extraction-3.0.0
      or higher.

        New in Release 1.1.11
* Vertex-based cortical volumes on resampled surfaces
* AAL atlas for surface parcellation (Gaolang Gong)

        New in Release 1.1.10
